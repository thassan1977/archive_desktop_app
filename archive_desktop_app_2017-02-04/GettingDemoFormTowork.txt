The Folowing adjusments were made in order to get the free image editor form 
DemoForm to work:

the standalone application Demo32.exe works just fine whereas the demo 
project DemoD2007 was not working due to units issues!
the issues and the solutions are :

 1 - in unit EnProWin, in type declaration:
the line:  TJPEGQuality = EnJpgGr.TJPEGQuality;    ///modified
was replaced by:  TJPEGQuality = EnMisc.TJPEGQuality;    ///modified
because TJPEGQuality is property of EnMisc and not of EnJpgGr.

 2- in unit Enprowin, in procedure TEnProWinFrame.SetConfigStr( value : String )
we replac declared string varaiables with new ansistring variables:
var  list, item,ansiValue : String;
var  list, item,ansiValue : ansiString; //modified
and in the next code (ipmlimentation) also:

   ansiValue := ansistring(Value);
//  while value <> '' do begin     //modified
//   list := EnStrGetNextToken( value, ';' );    //modified
  while ansiValue <> '' do begin
    list := EnStrGetNextToken( ansiValue, ';' );

 3- in unit EnProWin, in procedure TEnProWinFrame.ImageScrollBoxBeforeSave( const Sender: TImageScrollBox; const Graphic: TDibGraphic );
we had to stop this line from execution
  //  TTiffGraphic(Graphic).RowsPerStrip := Graphic.Height;//} //modified
this need to be seen once again!

 4- in unit EnProwin,procedure CalcPosPercent
( imgWinFrame : TEnProWinFrame; var pos : String; selection : Integer; var leftPct, topPct, widthPct, heightPct : Double );
the string variables were replaced by ansistring variables:
var
  s, t : ansiString;//modified
//    s, t :String;
  i : Integer;
  scrnAdjStr : ansiString;// //modified
  //scrnAdjStr : String;

 5 -in unit EnProwin,procedure TEnProWinFrame.DrawOverlayOnScreen
the string variables were replaced by ansistring variables:
//  list : String; //modified
  list : ansiString;

 6 -in unit EnProwin,procedure TEnProWinFrame.ImageSelection( Offset : Integer );
the string variables were replaced by ansistring variables:
//  s : String;  //modified
    s : ansiString;

 7 -in unit EnProwin,procedure TEnProWinFrame.ImageAdjustment( Adj : String );
the input string argument adj was casted to a ansistring:
var  adj_ansi:ansiString;
 adj_ansi :=adj;  //modified


 8- in unit EnProLib;
function  EnStrGetNextToken( var S : String; delimiter : String ) : String;
was replaced by:
function  EnStrGetNextToken( var S : AnsiString; delimiter : AnsiString ) : AnsiString;//modified

 9- in unit EnOCRTraining;procedure TEnOCRTrainingForm.MaskEditChange(Sender: TObject);
the string variables were replaced by ansistring variables:
//  input : String; //modified
  str : String;  //modified
  input,text_ansi : ansiString;
so the code modified as:
  retVal := EnPicture( text_ansi, input, FALSE, errPos );
//  retVal := EnPicture( MaskEdit.Text, input, FALSE, errPos );

 10- then jorject was compiled successfully. the form demoform was called inside
finit of unit ImgIdt. then it was called from jraction by EnvisionFormHandl
 when running the application it worked fine until closing the form 
DemoForm..a repeatedly error message was showed...it was cause by:
calling: Application.OnIdle := Self.OnIdle;
in  procedure TEditImageForm.FormCreate
application was originally the mainform which was demoform but now it is not!
the solution was inserting a new component: ApplicationEvents to handle DemoForm
being in idle mode!
